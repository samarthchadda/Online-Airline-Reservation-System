#Online-Airline-Reservation-System

This project is an angular based Flight booking System.

It has 2 roles: Administrator and Customer.
Administrators can perform CRUD operations on the flight, and Customers can search flights and can book them based on availability on seats.

I have used Web API, Bootstrap, Angular, Firebase for Building this application.
